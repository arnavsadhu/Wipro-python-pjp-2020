Note
Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created for HBO by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. It is an adaptation of 
A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels.[1][2] The story takes place on the fictional continents of 
Westeros and Essos, it has several plot lines and a large ensemble cast. The first story arc follows a dynastic conflict among competing
 claimants for succession to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, with other noble families fighting for independence from the throne.
 The second covers attempts to reclaim the throne by the exiled last scion of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty; the third chronicles 
the threat of the impending winter and the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North.[3]

The series, mostly written by Benioff and Weiss, has been nominated for many awards, including eight Golden Globe Awards (one win), ten 
Writers Guild of America Awards, seven Producers Guild of America Awards (one win), eight Directors Guild of America Awards (two wins), 
seven Art Directors Guild Awards (five wins), thirty-four Saturn Awards (six wins), fourteen Satellite Awards (three wins), and a 
Peabody Award (one win). The series has received 160 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including eight consecutive Outstanding Drama 
Series nominations, with 59 wins to date.[4] Game of Thrones received numerous nominations, with awards recognizing various aspects of 
the series such as directing, writing, cast, visual effects, or overall quality.

Peter Dinklage is the most awarded member of the cast, with recognitions such as the Primetime Emmy Award and Golden Globe for Best 
Supporting Actor in a Series. In addition, cast members Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, Kit Harington, Maisie Williams, Nikolaj 
Coster-Waldau, Alfie Allen, Sophie Turner, Gwendoline Christie, Carice van Houten, Diana Rigg, and Max von Sydow received Primetime 
Emmy Award nominations for their performances in the series.[5] The rest of the cast was also praised, many receiving various award 
nominations, including six Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series nominations rewarding 
all of the main cast for seasons 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. In 2015, Game of Thrones set a record for winning the highest number of Primetime
 Emmy Awards for a series in a single year, with 12 wins out of 24 nominations.[6] In 2016, it became the most awarded series in Emmy 
Awards history, with a total of 38 wins.[4] To date, Game of Thrones has won 290 awards out of 786 nominations. The show also holds six 
world records from the Guinness Book of World Records, including "Most pirated TV program" and "Largest TV drama simulcast".[7]

Emmy Awards
D. B. Weiss and David Benioff in 2013
D. B. Weiss and David Benioff received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for "Mother's Mercy" in 2015 and for "Battle of the Bastards" in 2016.
The Emmy Awards were established in 1949 in order to recognize excellence in the American television industry, and are bestowed by members of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. Emmy Awards are given in different ceremonies presented annually; Primetime Emmy Awards recognize outstanding work in American primetime television programming, while the Creative Arts Emmy Awards are presented to honor technical and creative achievements, and include categories recognizing work of art directors, lighting and costume designers, cinematographers, casting directors, and other production-based personnel.[166] The Emmy Award corresponds to the Academy Award (for film), the Tony Award (for theatre), and the Grammy Award (for music).[167]

Game of Thrones has won 59 out of 160 nominations.[5] Peter Dinklage has been nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series eight times for playing Tyrion Lannister, with wins in 2011, 2015, 2018 and 2019. Showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss have won twice for Writing for a Drama Series. Game of Thrones has eight nominations for Outstanding Drama Series, winning four, in 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019. Both David Nutter and Miguel Sapochnik have won for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series. Game of Thrones holds the Emmy Award record for most wins for a scripted television series, ahead of Frasier (which received 37).[168]

At the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards the show's fifth season was nominated for 24 awards. The show ultimately won 12 awards, setting a new record for most Emmy wins by a series in a single year, replacing the previous holder The West Wing's nine wins, and tying that show and Hill Street Blues for the most wins by a drama series throughout its run.[6] At the nominee announcement for the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards, the show's sixth season received the most nominations of any show with 23. The show again won 12 awards, tying the same record for most Emmy wins by a series in a single year.[5]

At the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards the seventh season was nominated for 22 awards, the most of the ceremony, including a first Emmy nomination for Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.[169] At the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards the eighth season was nominated for 32 awards, thus breaking the record for most nominations received by a regular series in a single year. Actors Alfie Allen, Gwendoline Christie, Sophie Turner and Carice van Houten all received their first Emmy Award nomination thanks to this season.[170]
